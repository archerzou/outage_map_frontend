Three boats from Waitangi came to their aid. The shingle bank which carried the railway and the main road from Napier to Hastings gave way under the pounding from the river. The dammed waters surged out and carried two of the rescue boats away to be overturned by the pounding waves. Ten men lost their lives.

There was swirling, fast-paced water on the North Road, originating from the hills behind Normanby. The water tore up road metal, leaving hollows the full length of the road and piles of metal. Huge pieces of asphalt were also lifted of footpaths and carried down the road. The main road footpath was broken away for 70 ft (20 m) of its length. The wires of the suspension bridge at the head of the Leith were banked up by debris, then the river overflowed, causing a rise of water at 4am on the 23rd. Leith Valley Road was closed, with a bridge destroyed by Nichol's Creek and timber piled up to 10 ft (3.0 m). Other highways closed included Kaikorai Valley Road, Union Street and Cliffs Road. The Main South road and the Green Island-Taieri Mouth road were scoured in many places. The Main South road was blocked at Green Island.
